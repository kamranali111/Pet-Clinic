## üìö Project Overview

This project covers the following topics:

- **Running the Project Locally**: Get the Spring Boot application up and running on your local machine.
- **Dockerizing the Application**: Create a Dockerfile using a multi-stage build for efficient Docker images.
- **Running the Application in a Docker Container**: Build and run the Docker container to make the application accessible through a specific port.
- **Integrating SonarQube for Code Analysis**: Set up SonarQube for analyzing the codebase and performing quality checks.

---

## üîß Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine before proceeding:

- **Java 17**
- **Gradle**
- **Docker**
- **SonarQube** (for code quality analysis)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamranali111/Pet-Clinic.git
cd Pet-Clinic
```

### 2. Running the Application Locally

To run the Spring Boot application on your local machine:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/workspace/Pet-Clinic
   ```

2. Use the following command to build and run the project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootrun
   ```

The application will start using **Java 17** and run on port **8090** by default. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) in your web browser.

## üê≥ Dockerizing the Application

This project uses a **multi-stage build** to create a Docker image, reducing the final image size.

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project with the following content:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM gradle:7.6.0-jdk17 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN ./gradlew clean build -x test

FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/build/libs/pet-clinic.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8090
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t pet-clinic .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8090:8090 pet-clinic
```

The application will now be accessible at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090).

## üß™ Integrating SonarQube for Code Analysis

Make sure SonarQube is running locally or on a server. You can run SonarQube using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
```

### SonarQube Configuration

Create a `sonar-project.properties` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```properties
sonar.projectKey=pet-clinic
sonar.projectName=Pet Clinic
sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000/
sonar.token=squ_9623951b24c0a5d5cf62c59b8968fb150e6710ad
sonar.java.binaries=build/classes/java/main,build/classes/java/test
```

### Running SonarScanner

Make sure you have SonarScanner installed. Then, run the following command in your project directory to analyze your code:

```bash
sonar-scanner
```

Follow the SonarQube setup instructions to analyze your codebase and perform quality checks.
